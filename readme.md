This is an unfinished project I started about 1 yr ago. I started it in the Laravel framework, which I beleive is the best PHP framework available.

It is composed of 3 parts:

<ul>
<li>A Laravel  MVC web solution. Heavily utilizes AngularJS for the interface.</li>
<li>A MySQL database with a few magic views.</li>
<li>A php command line task runner composed of 3 main tasks
<ul>
<li>A task that scrapes the steam store for new games.</li>
<li>A task that pulls in youtube videos of the game and generates short clips</li>
<li>A task that pulls in the user's games from their steam library</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
